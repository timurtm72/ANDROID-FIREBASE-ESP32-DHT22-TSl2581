# ANDROID-FIREBASE-ESP32-RTOS-IOT
Android application client works with Firebase and esp32 works the same through Firebase.
An anroid client to work with a real time database takes readings from a temperature and humidity DHT22 sensor, as well as a light TSL2581 sensor. 
The ESP32 board also interacts with the FIREBASE server as a client. 
In ESP32 uses RTOS.
All settings for identification numbers are taken and registered from the server.
